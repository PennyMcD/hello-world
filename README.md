# hello-world
Penny's repository... whatever that is.
I am an architectural technician with an idea which I think can be developed by learning Python. Python can link with Vectorworks I believe and I want to be able to change 3d images of buildings based on algorithms. It may be a crazy idea.. it may take years.
It's worth exploring anyway..
